### About me👀

I am a master student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at **the University of Waterloo** . I am exploring the best path for my future—whether to dedicate my life to research or to become a highly skilled professional engineer.

My current interests focus on understanding how people think, especially in situations where bias takes hold. I'm deeply curious about the reasons behind extreme biases—how emotions shape our perceptions, leading us to see the world through a distorted lens. It fascinates me how human emotions, in all their complexity, can both inspire and cloud our judgment, driving us to hold on to beliefs even when they hurt us or others. Unraveling these layers of thought and emotion is my passion, and I want to use my background in computer science, telecommunication, and AI technologies to help solve these problems. I believe that through these tools, we can bridge the divides and foster greater understanding in a world that often feels fragmented.
