### About me👀

I am a master student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at **the University of Waterloo** . I am exploring the best path for my future—whether to dedicate my life to research or to become a highly skilled professional engineer.

My current interests focus on understanding how people think, especially in situations where bias takes hold. I'm deeply curious about the reasons behind extreme biases—how emotions shape our perceptions, leading us to see the world through a distorted lens. It fascinates me how human emotions, in all their complexity, can both inspire and cloud our judgment, driving us to hold on to beliefs even when they hurt us or others. Unraveling these layers of thought and emotion is my passion, and I want to use my background in computer science, telecommunication, and AI technologies to help solve these problems. I believe that through these tools, we can bridge the divides and foster greater understanding in a world that often feels fragmented.

Why is that my interest?

    1.  I'm not someone who's particularly rich in emotions. Growing up, I was  away from my parents, living in unfamiliar places(school) on my own. While the emotional support from my family was quite limited, the material support was always abundant. Through intimate relationships and self-exploration, I began to uncover the mysteries of emotions, and I realized how much my way of thinking differs from others'.

    2.  In the environment(hometown) I grew up in, most people didn't know how to love others. They used a form of love that lacked communication, which led to an emotional deficiency in the community. Many people there lacked communication skills and held very extreme ideas.

    3.  I truly want to learn how to love and care for others. I also want to use the skills I've learned to solve what I believe is a key issue on the path to human happiness.
