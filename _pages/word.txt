I am now a research assistant supervised by [Prof.Chengniang Sun](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cnsun/public/).

    1.  I'm not someone who's particularly rich in emotions. Growing up, I was  away from my parents, living in unfamiliar places(school) on my own. While the emotional support from my family was quite limited, the material support was always abundant. Through intimate relationships and self-exploration, I began to uncover the mysteries of emotions, and I realized how much my way of thinking differs from others'.

    2.  In the environment(hometown) I grew up in, most people didn't know how to love others. They used a form of love that lacked communication, which led to an emotional deficiency in the community. Many people there lacked communication skills and held very extreme ideas.

    3.  I truly want to learn how to love and care for others. I also want to use the skills I've learned to solve what I believe is a key issue on the path to human happiness.
